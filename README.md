# BombermanGame

I took a Computer Games and Simulations course at school on the first semester of my senior year.

I created this game for my term project for the course.
- The game contains sprites for the characters, walls, floor, bombs, and explosions.
- The game contains animations for the movement of the characters, the explosion of the bomb, and a small victory dance for the winning character.
- The game contains a UI including 3 options, Start, Help, and Exit. The information about how to play the game can be seen upon clicking the Help button.

The logic is the same as the classic game Bomberman.

Features:
- There are two characters, red and blue.
- Both characters can be controlled from one keyboard.
- Characters can only move up, down, left, and right.
- Characters can not move diagonally.
- Both players have 3 lives.
- There are life stars spawning 10 seconds after they are picked up.
- The life stars can be spawned in any one of the 10 predefined spots of the map.
- Life stars give the player who collected it a life point, but can not exceed 3.
- A player dies after losing all 3 life points.


Thank you for your time ^^
